Picture this: 

You want to get your most prized photos printed and mounted, but local imagers charge you an arm, leg, *and* a kidney for their services?

Here at Print n' Mount, we believe that prints and mounting should be charged as one service. That's why we only charge a flat fee for **BOTH** printing and mounting onto foam board. 

All photos will be of archival grade as they are printed on acid-free paper and mounted on acid-free foam board with acid-free glue. 

Our **RATES** are determined by the size of your prints:

* 11 x 14 : CAD$65
* 16 x 20 : CAD$90
* 20 x 24 : CAD$110
* 24 x 30 : CAD$145
* 30 x 40 : CAD$210
* 40 x 50 : CAD$330
