Picture *this*: 

You want to get your most prized photos printed and mounted but local imagers charge you an arm, leg, *and* a kidney for their services?

Here at Print n' Mount, we believe that prints and mounting should be charged as one service. It's rather straightforward: we charge a flat fee for **BOTH** fine-art printing and borderless mounting onto foam board. 

Each print is worked on by skilled hands to ensure that as they will last as long as the high quality acid-free paper and acid-free foam board will allow. This is around 100 years!

Our **RATES** are determined by the size of your fine-art prints:

* 11 x 14 : CAD$65
* 16 x 20 : CAD$90
* 20 x 24 : CAD$110
* 24 x 30 : CAD$145
* 30 x 40 : CAD$210
* 40 x 50 : CAD$330

We also offer film enlargements and mounting so **contact us** today and have your your photos professionally printed and mounted for less!
